Public data related to various aspects of the Police force in USA. Data is sourced from multiple kaggle public datasets that could be found at the following links:

Out of the seven CSVs in this repository, six are sourced from the kaggle datasets. For the Kaggle data we chose, the data is best grabbed by downloading the entire Kaggle data, and then picking the csvs individually from the zipfile downloaded. The CensusData (1).csv is a publicly available census data collected from https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219 using a proprietary web-scraper. One could grab the data one by one by just putting in specific cities and downloading the csv for each.
